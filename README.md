# PID Control Project
*Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program*
---

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to control steering and throttle with a PID controler and navigate the vehicle around the track as safely as possible.

This differs from the project in Term 1 in that the vehicle has no knowledge of the world other than it's deviation from the centerline (cross track error).

## Build Instructions
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`

## Implementation
Two different PID controllers are used to control the steering and throttle independently.

### Parameter Tuning
The steering and throttle parameters were adjusted by trial and error until a suitable combination was found. 

#### Steering


#### Throttle
